# Audio Peer Visualization

Welcome to the **Audio Peer Visualization** project. This advanced **3D visualization system** is designed to dynamically represent audio data on 3D structures, such as buildings. Developed using the **Unity Engine**, it provides an innovative solution for transforming sound into visually immersive experiences, emphasizing technical and artistic precision.

## Key Features

- **Audio Visualization**: Converts audio data into detailed 3D visual patterns projected onto structures.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Real-time visual effects respond to changes in audio frequency and intensity.
- **Immersive 3D Environment**: Presents a fully-rendered, visually captivating 3D space for exploration and interaction.
- **Advanced Unity Techniques**: Utilizes Unity’s Universal Render Pipeline for optimized performance and visual fidelity.
- **Non-Gaming Application**: Focused on artistic and technical applications beyond traditional gaming contexts.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity Engine (URP)**
- **C# Programming Language**
- **Audio Analysis Algorithms**
